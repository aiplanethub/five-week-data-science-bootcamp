# Pie Chart

### What is Pie Chart?&#x20;

* A pie chart (or a circle chart) is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices(wedges) to illustrate numerical proportion. \

* Imagine a pizza where different slices contain different toppings. Bigger the slice, larger the amount of that topping is present.\
