# Day 1 & Day 2: Descriptive Statistics, Transformations and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Learning Objectives

* Measures of Dispersion
* Transformations
* EDA with Seaborn
* Additional Python Topics

### **Measures of Dispersion**

* **Range:** It is the diÔ¨Äerence between highest value and the lowest value in the data set. \
  For a given list of numbers: 10, 20, 40, 10, 70 the range is 70 - 10 = 60.\

* **Variance:** The average of the squared diÔ¨Äerences from the mean. Steps to calculate variance:
  * Calculate mean (mean is nothing but average)
  * Find diÔ¨Äerence of each data from mean
  * Square all the diÔ¨Äerences
  * Take the average of the squares.\

* **Standard Deviation:** It shows you how much your data is spread out around the mean. Its symbol is ùõî (the greek letter sigma). It is the square root of the **variance.**     &#x20;

### **Standard Deviation**                                           &#x20;

### Calculate Variance

**Steps to calculate variance:**

* Calculate mean
* Find diÔ¨Äerence of each data from mean
* Square all the diÔ¨Äerences
* Take the average of the squares.

Consider the list of numbers: 10, 20, 40, 10, 70.

* Mean of the number is 30.
* DiÔ¨Äerence of each data from the mean: -20, -10, 10, -20, 40.
* Square of all the diÔ¨Äerences: 400, 100, 100, 400, 1600
* Take the average of the squares: (400 + 100 + 100 + 400 + 1600) / 5 = 2600 / 5 = 520

### Standardization / Normalization

* Often variables in a real dataset come with a wide range of data values.
* **For example** let‚Äôs look at the wine dataset given in next slide, the **Ô¨Åxed.acidity variable has values ranging from 3.8 to 14.2**.&#x20;
* Similarly, if we look at **volatile.acidity, it has values ranging from 0.08 to 1.10**. Basically, they are not on a common scale.

**Now how does standardization/normalization help?**

* Performing standardization/normalization would bring all the variables in a dataset to a common scale so that it could further help in implementing various machine learning models (where standardization/normalization is a pre-requisite to apply such models).&#x20;
* Again, don‚Äôt take this for granted, there are some smart algorithms which doesn‚Äôt need this and we will explore them soon!

* Look at the above graphs. The actual data is scattered across a wide range.
* Normalisation helps in bringing the whole data within a particular range.
* Standardisation distributes the data in a manner such that it now has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.

### Transformation

Some machine learning algorithms are quite sensitive to the scale of the numeric values provided.

Consequently, in order for the algorithm to converge faster or to provide a more exact solution, rescaling the distribution is necessary. Rescaling mutates the range of the values of the features and can aÔ¨Äect variance, too. You can perform features rescaling in two ways:

* Using statistical **standardization** (z-score normalization): \
  Standardization typically means rescaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance).
* Using the min-max transformation (or **normalization**):\
  Normalization typically means rescaling the values into a range of \[0,1].

### EDA with Seaborn

In today‚Äôs session, we‚Äôll be performing EDA by visualising data with Seaborn (speciÔ¨Åcally with scatterplot, countplot, distplot, boxplot and heatmap).

Please go through the following material to understand these diÔ¨Äerent plots:

### **Additional Python Topics (Optional)**

**(This is for self-learning for the session and may not be required in near time - you can consider this as optional)**

* A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
* A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
* Syntax:

lambda arguments : expression

* Example:

### Python Lambda Function

A lambda function that adds 10 to the number passed in as an argument, and prints the result:

### Python List Comprehension

* One of the Python‚Äôs most distinctive features is the list comprehension, which you can use to create powerful functionality within a single line of code.
* List comprehension is generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.
* MUST READ: Learn about list comprehension from here: [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-comprehension](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-comprehension)

### Python Regular Expression

* A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or Ô¨Ånd other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern.
* Must Read: Go through the following link to get an overview of how regular expression are used in Python: [https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python\_reg\_expressions.htm](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python\_reg\_expressions.htm)
* It is usually a confusing topic for most programmers. So don‚Äôt worry if you‚Äôre not able to fully understand it.
