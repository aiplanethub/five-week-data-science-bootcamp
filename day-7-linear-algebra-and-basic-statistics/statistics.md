* A branch of mathematics that takes and transform the data into some useful information which in turn is used to make some decisions.
* Statistics is concerned with:
  * Processing and analyzing data
  * Collecting, presenting and transforming data to assist decision maker

### What is Data?

Data are facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.

### Data Types in Statistics

#### Categorical

* **Nominal:** Doesn’t have an order. For example: Gender of a person (male or female)
* **Ordinal:** Has some order in place. For example:

Grades of students (ﬁrst division, second division and third division)

#### Numerical

* **Discrete:** Discrete Data can only take certain values. They are distinct and separate.

Example: the number of students in a class. We can't have half a Student!

* **Continuous:** Continuous Data can take any value (within a range).

A person's height: could be any value (within the range of human heights), not just certain ﬁxed heights.

**!!!** we will get used to these terms soon, no need worry too much about it. Read this article for additional information: [https://builtin.com/data-science/data-types-statistics](https://builtin.com/data-science/data-types-statistics)

### Measures of Central Tendencies

* **Mean:** The mean is the [average ](https://www.statisticshowto.com/arithmetic-mean/)of a data set. For example, take a list of numbers: 10, 20, 40, 10, 70

Mean = (10 + 20 + 40 + 10 + 70) / 5 = 30

* **Median:** The median is the middle of the set of numbers. To ﬁnd the median, ﬁrst we sort the list of numbers:

10, 10, 20, 40, 70

The exact middle number i.e. 20 is the median.

* **Mode:** The mode is the most common number in a data set.

In above list of numbers, 10 has occurred 2 times while other three numbers are occurred one time each.

So, the mode is 10 here.

### Applications of Central Tendencies

**MEAN:** When you watch a baseball game and you see the player's batting average, that number represents the total number of hits divided by the number of times at bat. In other words, that number is the mean. In school, the ﬁnal grade you get in a course is usually a mean. This mean represents the total number of points you scored in the class divided by the number of possible points. This is the classic type of average – when your overall performance on many items is evaluated with a single number.

**MEDIAN:** Although the mean is the most common type of average, the median can also be used to express the average of a group. You may hear about the median salary for a country or city. When the average income for a country is discussed, the median is most often used because it represents the middle of a group. Mean allows very high or very low numbers to sway the outcome but median is an excellent measure of the center of a group of data.

**MODE:** Imagine that you live in a small town where most of the people are employed by a factory and earn minimum wage. One of the factory owners lives in the town and his salary is in the millions of dollars. If you use a measure like the average to try to compare salaries in the town as a whole, the owner's income would severely throw oﬀ the numbers. This is where the measure of mode can be useful in the real world. It tells you what most of the pieces of data are doing within a set of information.&#x20;
