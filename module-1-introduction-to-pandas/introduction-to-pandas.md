# Introduction to Pandas

### Learning Objectives

* What is Pandas?
* Why Pandas?
* Why Pandas is so popular?
* Import Pandas in Python

### What is Pandas?

* Officially stands for **Python Data Analysis Library**
* It is an open - source Python library
* It is a tool used by data scientists to:
  * read,
  * write,
  * manipulate, and&#x20;
  * analyse the data.

### Why Pandas?

* It helps you to explore and manipulate data in an efficient manner
* It helps you to analyse large volumes of data with ease. When we say large volumes it is in millions of rows/records.

### Why Pandas is so Popular?

* Easy to read and learn
* Extremely fast and powerful
* Integrates well with other visualisation libraries

### Importing Pandas

Anytime you want to use a library in Python, your first priority should be to make it accessible.

You can import/load Pandas in your notebook or any other Python IDE in two different ways.

* **import pandas**
* **import pandas as pd**

Just as we use the `np` shorthand for NumPy, we will be using `pd` shorthand for Pandas. It simply serves as an alias and it is easier to use `pd` instead writing full form ‘pandas’ while coding.

In this course, we will use **`import pandas as pd`**
